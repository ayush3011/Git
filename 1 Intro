Git is a version control system. Its uses include
    --> Easily recover files
    --> Who introduced an issue and when?
    --> Roll back to previously working state


History of VCS(Version Control Systems) :
              ( for more information https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-software-version-control/the-history-of-version-control#:~:text=The%20first%20Version%20Control%20System,worked%20with%20Source%20Code%20files.)


    --> Local VCS - stores files locally. eg. like database to keep track of files
            pros - can track files and roll back.
            cons - if you lose your hard disk or any way it is crashed, you lose all your data.

    
    --> Centralised VCS
            Server-------------> Client
    

    --> Distributed VCS (Git is an example of Distributed VCS)
            Server-------------> Client (main)

Features of Git :

    --> It keeps the snapshot and not the difference.
    --> Almost every operation is local unless you are pushing something on the remote server.
    --> Git has integrity, i.e. your data is well protected form changes by unwanted sources through file checksum method.
    --> Git generally adds the data.



IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER :

1. REPOSITORY - It is nothing but a term given to a folder or the directory when we start tracking the files in it using git. 
2. We can use starting words and press tab key to complete those words.
3. Git does not track blank folders.
4. If we just change the name of our file and not the content in it, initially, until tracked, git would think that the earlier file was deleted and a new file with a new name has been added to the working directory, which is still untracked. 
But as soon as you add the same changed file to the staging area, git would now specify it as a renamed file, taking in account the content in it is not changed.
5. We can also filter the commits as we want them to be. (https://youtu.be/Hxn3OguEMd4)
